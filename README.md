# ðŸ¤– Lecture 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis with Plotting and Visualization

Being able to visualise your data and to produce publication quality graphics are key components of the data science approach. Since *"picture is worth a thousand words"*  data can be often better understood when displayed in graphical format rather than a table. 

Therefore the fist step of any data science project is 'Exploratory Data Analysis', often referred to as EDA. EDA is curiosity driven, and is largely concerned with plotting data, looking for hidden correlations, and regrouping the data in a meaningful way.

Python has a strong ecosystem when it comes to ploting figures and EDA. We will mainly look at two libraries: Matplotlib, and Seaborn. With these you can do pretty much any graphical representation you want, using Python code. Although it may seem a bit cumbersome at first to use code to plot graphs, once you have defined graphic functions to make your plot look exactly the way you want, you can apply this function over and over again. So this is an efficient way to prepare and vizualise large volume of data as it scales up easily to new datasets.
